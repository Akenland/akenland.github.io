### Logging in
You must be using a legitimate version of Minecraft Java Edition to play on Akenland. If you cannot connect to the server using the information on the right, please visit our Discord server for further help.

### Performance
We constantly monitor server performance to ensure a good experience. Please ask an Admin if you notice any issues such as inconsistent movement, blocks not breaking as expected, mobs or players lagging, etc...

To improve FPS, we strongly recommend the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized). It greatly improves FPS for most players, and additionally provides a number of other useful features, as well as visual improvements with our [Revival resource pack](https://revival.akenland.com/).

### Other technical issues
Please ask an Admin either in-game or on Discord for help. Bugs or glitches in plugins may be reported to Kade.

## World, farthings, and continents
Our custom 20,000 x 10,000 world is divided into four regions, known as farthings. The two most frequented are on the main continent, known as the Akenland. The other two make up the north and south wilderness.
### Peaceful Zones (no PvP, griefing, or stealing)
- <span class="waramon">Waramon</span>
  - West half of Akenland
- <span class="eborin">Eborin</span>
  - East half of Akenland
### PvP Zones (PvP and stealing allowed, limited griefing)
- <span class="sholkingham">Sholkingham</span> - Three northern continents
  - Estril
  - Bornstead
  - Abbistone
- <span class="runnach">R첫nnach</span> - Three southern continents
  - Skarn
  - Abithyre
  - Temic

The continent of Akenland also includes the Aunix Sanctuary in the middle, which is our server spawn. You can fast travel here from any Warpstone.

You may not teleport or warp between continents. For example, if you are in Temic, you cannot fast travel to Skarn. You must first travel to Skarn, such as by boat, and then you can use Warpstones, Warp Shards, Nether Portals, or the /tp command to fast travel within Skarn.

Each continent has a separate Nether (total of seven). Portals cannot be used to fast travel between continents.

## Realms
All players are members of a single realm. New players may choose the Clan of Waramon, or the Thaindom of Eborin, which determines which half of Akenland they will start on.

Player names in chat indicate their allegience. The bracket colour indicates their farthing, and the name colour typically matches their realm.

### Farthing Hubs
Farthing Hubs are neutral locations where players can join a different realm, start a new realm, trade, or safely engage in diplomacy. Visit your Farthing Hub for details. You can fast travel to the Farthing Hub from any Warpstone on the same continent.
<span class="waramon">Waramon</span> - City of Dunburk
<span class="eborin">Eborin</span> - City of Abrindor
<span class="sholkingham">Sholkingham</span> - TBD, Estril
<span class="runnach">R첫nnach</span> - Port Islington, Temic

Services offered:
- Joining realms
  - Players may freely join Waramon or Eborin
  - Joining a realm in Sholkingham or R첫nnach requires approval of realm leader
- Starting new realms
  - Only allowed in Sholkingham and R첫nnach - players may not start new realms in Waramon or Eborin
  - You must have at least 4 other players (total of 5+) to join your realm, and all must visit the Farthing Hub together
- Market
  - Access the global market - Create or accept bulk item trade deals between realms
  - Access local markets - Purchase items that are currently being sold by a realm
  - Traveling merchants - Purchase from a limited, rotating selection of rare items
- Diplomacy
  - General meetings - access meeting rooms for discussions with other players
  - Rule investigations - when needed, players will be summoned here for investigations into broken rules, such as our strategic griefing rules
  - Declaring or ending war - all involved realms must set up a meeting with an Admin present, in order to declare war and thus be exempt from griefing rules, as well as to end a war

## Warpstones
Warpstones allow you to fast travel around the world, using floating structures made of stone and lapis lazuli. Each Warpstone is a fast travel destination.

Approach a Warpstone to save it as a destination.
- If you are not at full health, you mmay need to right-click the Warpstone and stand still
- The three most-recently visited Warpstones will be saved

Right-click a Warpstone to fast travel to any of the following:
- Your home bed
- The Farthing Hub for the farthing you are currently in
- Aunix Sanctuary (server spawn)
- Events Hub (special events and activities located at spawn)
- The three most-recently visited Warpstones

With the exception of the two destinations at spawn, you can only warp to destinations if they are not on a different continent. For example, if your home bed is in Akenland, you can warp to it from anywhere in Waramon or Eborin, but not from any of the six outer continents.

### Warp Dust
This dust drops randomly when using Warpstones, or when mining lapis lazuli ore. Use it to craft Warp items. It can also be used in place of lapis lazuli for most crafting recipes.

### Warp Shards
Warp Shards allow you to save a Warpstone as a destination, bypassing the limit of three recent Warpstones.

Craft them from four Warp Dust. Hold a shard in your main hand while approaching or activating a Warpstone to set the destination. Later, you can again hold this linked shard while activating another Warpstone, and you will be returned to the Warpstone where you linked it.

Warp Shards are single-use. They can be given or sold to other players, and may be stolen in PvP Zones.

You still need to be on the correct continent in order to use Warp Shards.

### Warp Hearts
Warp Hearts have no use on their own, but are used to craft more powerful items. Craft one from four Warp Dust, four Warp Shards, and an Eye of Ender. Once crafted, they cannot be used in crafting immediately - you must first charge them by visiting Warpstones. The charge rate is faster when you activate Warpstones that you have not visited recently - visitng the same Warpstone over and over will not charge the Warp Heart.

### Charged Warp Shards
Charged Shards allow you to save any location as a fast travel destination, instead of just at a Warpstone.

Stand where you want the destination to be, and craft a Warp Heart with an Ender Pearl. The Warp Heart must be charged at least 25% to produce 8 shards, and each additional 25% charge will produce another 8 shards, up to a maximum of 32 shards with a fully charged Warp Heart.

The location you are standing will be set as the destination, so choose carefully. Like regular shards, charged shards are single-use, can be given, sold, or stolen, and require you to be on the correct continent to use them.

### Storage Interstices
Storage Interstices allow you to remotely access a chest or other container.

They are crafted from a fully-charged Warp Heart, a chest, and seven iron ingots. Once crafted, hold it while right-clicking a chest or other container to link it. You can change the linked container by sneak-right-clicking a different one. In addition to chests, you can link to barrels, hoppers, or even furnaces. If the block is broken, the Storage Interstice will not be usable unless the block is replaced.

Right-click while holding the Storage Interstice to access the chest's contents. Storage Interstices have limited charge, and adding or removing items will consume charge. The discharge rate is increased as you move further from the linked container. Once the charge is depleted, the Storage Interstice cannot be used until it is repaired with a new, fully-charged Warp Heart at an anvil.

Storage Interstices bypass chest locks. If stolen in a PvP Zone, the thief will have full access to the linked chest, without even needing to visit your base, so be careful!

### Ender Storage Interstices
By crafting a Storage Interstice with an Ender Chest instead of a regular chest, it will be linked to your Ender Chest. It cannot be linked to any other container, but otherwise works similarly to a regular Storage Interstice.

If another player tries to use the Ender Storage Interstice, they will see their own Ender Chest contents, not yours - just like normal Ender Chests.
